  # How to Contribute to Hops

  First off, we really value your contribution. Thanks for wanting to help us with your time and talent! :rainbow:

  ### Did you find a bug?

  * Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/xing/hops/issues).

  * If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/xing/hops/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

  ### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

  * Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

  * Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

  ### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

  * Suggest your change as an issue on GitHub to collect positive feedback about the proposal before starting to actually write code.

  * Before submitting code, please make sure you update or extend the existing test cases and, by all means, run `yarn test` in Hops' root folder.

  Hops uses the [semistandard code style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard). Please make sure your code also adheres to it before submitting: Run `yarn lint`

  Thanks! :green_heart:
