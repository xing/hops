Hops is a modular development, build and runtime environment for universal ("isomorphic") web applications. It focuses on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Hops is designed to simplify getting started with modern frontend tooling. It streamlines [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) configuration featuring [Babel](https://babeljs.io) and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org).

### Quick start

If you just want to get started with hops + react you can execute the following command to initialize a small example app:

If you have npm >= 5.2.0 installed:

```shell
npx hops init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
npm start
```

Otherwise:

```shell
npm install --global hops
hops init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
npm start
```

This will start hops in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your app in the browser and make some changes to the code in your editor to see it live-reloading.

If you want to build the JS bundles for production, run `npm run build` in your terminal and to start a Node.js server just type in `npm start --production`.

### Project Templates

Hops comes with a couple of different project templates you can use with `hops init --template`. If you do not explicitly select one, `hops init` defaults to `hops-template-react`.

| Package                                                                                     | NPM                                                                                                                   |

| [Hops Template React](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/template-react)     | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hops-template-react.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hops-template-react)     |
| [Hops Template GraphQL](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/template-graphql) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hops-template-graphql.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hops-template-graphql) |

If, for example, you want to bootstrap your project to use both React and GraphQL, you will have to call `hops init` like this:

```shell
hops init my-graphql-project --template hops-template-graphql
```

### General Usage

Hops is quite modular, its components being independently published on npm. Its main building blocks, however, rely upon each other:

| Package                                                                             | NPM                                                                                                           |

The following additional packages are rather low-level and you'll probably never need to install and use them directly.

### Contributing

Hops uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for development and publishing of the packages. Therefore it is required to have `yarn` globally available.

If you want to contribute to this project, create a fork of its [repository](https://github.com/xing/hops/fork) using the GitHub UI. Check out your new fork to your computer:

```bash
mkdir hops && cd $_
git clone git@github.com:user/hops.git .
```

Afterwards, you can `yarn install` the required dependencies and then run `yarn bootstrap` to install the dependencies of all packages and link the packages together.

Using `yarn start` will execute the `start` script in the [hops-template-react](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/template-react) so that you can verify your changes in the browser.

When you are finished, please do go ahead and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Hops is entirely written in ECMAScript 5 and its code is formatted using [prettier](https://prettier.io). Please make sure your contribution does, too.
