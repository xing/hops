# This example demonstrates how to extend types (and use types) from other
# schemas. In this example we are extending the "Query" type and are using the
# "User" type, both of which are defined in the GitHub schema.
# See also: ../index.js and ../../package.json for an example of how to
# configure these custom schema additions and resolvers.

extend type Query {
  version: String
  me: User
}
