# This example demonstrates how to define a resolver for unions that consist
# of multiple types.
# In this case the union "SearchablePerson" can be either "Account" or
# "Contact".
# See also: ../index.js and ../../package.json for an example of how to
# configure these custom schema additions and resolvers.

union SearchablePerson = Account | Contact

extend type Query {
  searchPersons: [SearchablePerson]
