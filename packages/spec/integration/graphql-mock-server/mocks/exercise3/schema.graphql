# This example demonstrates how to use interface types from other schemas.
# Any interface defined in other schemas (that are loaded before this schema),
# will be available inside this schema.
# In this case we are using the "Node" interface that is provided by the GitHub
# schema.
# See also: ../index.js and ../../package.json for an example of how to
# configure these custom schema additions and resolvers.
