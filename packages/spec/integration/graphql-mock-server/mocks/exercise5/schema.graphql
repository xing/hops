# This example demonstrates how to define a resolver for interfaces that are
# implemented by multiple types.
# In this case the Interfaces "Person" and "Node" are both implemented by the
# types "Account" and "Contact".
# See also: ../index.js and ../../package.json for an example of how to
# configure these custom schema additions and resolvers.

  id: ID
  name: String

  name: String
  phone: String
