# Hops

**Please see the [main Hops Readme](../../DOCUMENTATION.md) for general information and a Getting Started Guide.**

Hops is everything you need to develop and deploy a production grade universal web application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It provides both a **universal runtime** as well as the necessary **build tooling**.

## Quick start

To create a new Hops application run the following in a terminal:

```shell
npx create-hops-app my-hops-app
```

_Note: If you prefer to use `yarn`, you can substitute the above command with `yarn create hops-app my-hops-app`._

Then move into the newly created directory:

```shell
cd my-hops-app
```

And start the development server:

```shell
npm start
```

This will start Hops in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your app in the browser and make some changes to the code in your editor to see it live-reloading.

Check out the [main Hops Readme](../../DOCUMENTATION.md) for more detailed explanations and documentation.
