# Hops Build Config

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hops-build-config.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hops-build-config)

hops-build-config exposes webpack configurations for Node.js, browser and webpack-dev-server.

# Installation

When you install [hops-build](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/build), hops-build-config will be installed as a dependency as well - so you don't necessarily have to separately install hops-build-config.

However iff you want to use it in your app directly (for example to extend it), install it by running

```
npm install --save hops-build-config
```

# Usage

Please find a list of the default configs below. If you use [hops-config](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/config), too, you can easily [overwrite / extend](#overwrite-configs-via-packagejson) these configurations.

## Available options

| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buildConfig`   | `String` | Path to your Webpack build configuration file. Defaults to `./node_modules/hops-build-config/configs/build.js`                     |
| `developConfig` | `String` | Path to your Webpack development configuration file. Defaults to `./node_modules/hops-build-config/configs/develop.js`             |
| `nodeConfig`    | `String` | Path to your Webpack node/server-side rendering configuration file. Defaults to `./node_modules/hops-build-config/configs/node.js` |

## Custom Webpack configuration

Webpack configurations can be nasty to handle, therefore we recommend using [webpack-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge) if you want to extend one of the existing Webpack configurations.

The following example shows how to overwrite / extend the webpack configurations:

#### `package.json`

```JSON
"name": "my-application",
"version": "1.0.0",
"config": {
    "hops": {
      "buildConfig": "./path-to-my-custom-webpack-config/build.js",
      "developConfig": "./path-to-my-custom-webpack-config/develop.js",
      "nodeConfig": "./path-to-my-custom-webpack-config/node.js"
    }
  }
```

#### `./path-to-my-custom-webpack-config/build.js`

```javascript
var webpack = require('webpack');
var hopsBuildConfig = require('hops-build-config/configs/build');
var merge = require('webpack-merge');

var myCustomBuildConfig = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin({
      MY_CUSTOM_ENV: 'myFallbackValue',
    }),
  ],
};

module.exports = merge.strategy(
  { plugins: 'append' },
  hopsBuildConfig,
  myCustomBuildConfig
);
```

Please head over to the documentation of [webpack-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge) to see the full list of merge strategies to find out which one to use.

## Default configuration

hops-build-config provides a minimal, yet convenient default configuration. Furthermore, when starting a development server, source maps will be generated.

### Files/Assets

| File type                                     | Loader action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `graphql` `gql`                               | Files of these types are interpreted as GraphQL. You need to manually install [Hops' GraphQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hops-graphql) for this to work                                                                                                                          |
| `html` `svg` `otf` `ttf` `woff` `woff2` `ico` | Files of these types are emitted to the directory defined in `assetPath`                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `png` `gif` `jpeg` `jpg` `webp`               | Same as above, except when a file of this type is smaller than 10kb in size. In that case, it will be converted to a base64-encoded data URL and embedded inline                                                                                                                    |
| `json`                                        | Files of this type are loaded and their content is returned                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `tpl`                                         | Files of this type are parsed by [\_.template](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#template) and their content is returned as a function. By providing such a file, you can for example override the default template provided by [hops-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hops-react) |
