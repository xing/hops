# Hops Server

Hops server is a small collection of shared functionality that can be used in
express-like interfaces to register the hops-middleware.

It also exports a simple middleware that takes care of rewriting the paths of
incoming http requests based on the values set in hops-config.

*exports:*
- `rewritePath(request, response, next) => void`  
`rewritePath` is an express-style middleware that adds a trailing slash to the
url of the incoming request.

- `registerMiddleware(app, middleware) => void`  
`registerMiddleware` is a helper function that registers a wildcard middleware
for every location defined in the hops-config, if available.
Otherwise it registers the given middleware for a wildcard route at the root.

- `run(app, callback) => void`  
`run` is a helper function that starts the express-like server with the parameters
defined in hops-config.

- `bootstrap(app, hopsConfig) => void`  
`teardown(app, hopsConfig) => void`  
These functions allow to customize the server through hops-config.  
It is possible to define `hopsConfig.bootstrapServer` and `hopsConfig.teardownServer`
to override these functions and execute some custom logic on the `app` object.


### Target Audience

If you want to build an express-like server and reuse the hops-config while doing so,
then this middleware will help dealing with the locations and basePath config.


### Example

#### `app.js`
```javascript
var path = require('path');
var express = require('express');
var server = require('hops-server');
var hopsConfig = require('hops-config');

// The middleware is being generated by hops-build, based on the webpack node config
var pathToGeneratedMiddleware = path.join(hopsConfig.cacheDir, 'server.js');

var app = express();
app.use(server.rewritePath);
// bootstrap and teardown provide hooks to customize the server through hops-config
server.bootstrap(app, hopsConfig);
server.registerMiddleware(require(pathToGeneratedMiddleware));
// bootstrap and teardown provide hooks to customize the server through hops-config
server.teardown(app, hopsConfig);
server.run(app);
```
