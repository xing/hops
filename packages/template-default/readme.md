# Hops Example

This folder contains an example hops project set up for development with [React](http://reactjs.com) and [React Router](https://react-router.now.sh) using the latest ECMAScript and CSS features.

Babel, PostCSS and hops itself are configured using only `package.json`. During a build, an `index.html` is being generated using the very same React components that are being used within the browser.

Run this demo by `npm install`ing it and `npm start`ing it afterwards.
