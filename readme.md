Hops is a modular development and build environment for universal ("isomorphic") web applications. It leverages [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org).

Hops is designed to simplify getting started with modern frontend tooling. It streamlines [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) configuration and features [Babel](https://babeljs.io) and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org).


### Installation

Besides reasonably recent versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), hops has no global dependencies. If you need those, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or similar.

If you want to go all in with hops, here's what you have to do and install to create a basic project..:

```shell
mkdir foo && cd foo
npm init -y
npm install -S hops-cli hops-config \
  hops-react react react-dom react-helmet react-router react-router-dom \
  hops-redux redux redux-thunk react-redux
```


### Setup

After installing hops into your project, you need to set it up. This can be done within your project's `package.json` file. The relevant fields are shown below:

```javascript
{
  "browser": "src/browser.js",
  "server": "src/server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "hops start"
  },
  "config": {
    "hops": {
      "locations": [
        "/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Hops relies heavily on this file for configuration. In the example above, there are two entry points for `browser` and `server` - that is, two files that are used for client and server builds.

Hops provides a runner that you can call from the scripts of your `package.json` and is configured using the `hops` config object also contained therein. In this example, the only configuration option provided is `locations`, an array of paths that will be used for generating static html files using the middleware you provide.


### Running

For developing using hops, you can use any decent editor with up-to-date language support. Those without a favorite we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io), probably with the [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter), [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) and [linter-stylelint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint) plugins.

Assuming you edited your `package.json` as outlined above, you can fire up a dev server or trigger a production build like so:

```shell
npm start (--production)
```

If called with the `--production` flag, a production mode server is launched. Otherwise, a development server featuring hot module replacement is started. Hops can generate html pages for all `locations` listed in its config at build time, so you don't need a node server in production, but still can enjoy the benefits of a true universal JavaScript application.


### Advanced Usage

Hops is quite modular, its component being independently published on npm. Its main building blocks, however, rely upon each other:

* [Hops CLI](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/cli)
* [Hops Config](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/config)
* [Hops React](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/react)
* [Hops Redux](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/redux)

The following additional packages are rather low-level and you'll probably never need to install and use them directly.

* [Hops Transpiler](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/transpiler)
* [Hops Middleware](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/middleware)
* [Hops Renderer](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/renderer)
* [Hops Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/packages/plugin)


### Alternatives

* [Next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
* [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
* [Backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack)
